## Projects for others to maintain

I have written a couple of Flatpak manifests but I am not planning on publishing them in Flathub anytime soon. If you want to maintain one of them, feel free to publish them in Flathub: Fork my repo (see below), choose the flatpak you want to maintain, and submit a merge request in the `flathub/new-pr` repo.
